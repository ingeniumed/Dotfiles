# Dotfiles

These are the configurations for the various services that I use across my various systems. I have organized them by folders, with each folder name representing the service that it is used for. They are:

* Docker: This holds the docker-compose file wherein lies the ability to build ombi, sonarr, radarr, plex, hydra2, sabnzbd, watchtower containers and have them be connected to each other. The intention is to have an end to end system that you can use to request media, and then have it be automatically downloaded and sorted into the respective folders mentioned in the config. There will be the need to expose some folders as defined in the config, but that can be adjusted. Right now they are in the format that I like, but it changeable.
